<p> The Butterfly Effect: This effect is the power to cause a hurricane in a place such as China by a butterfly flapping its wings in New Mexico. It may take a very long time, but the connection is real. If the butterfly had not flapped its wings at just the right point in space/time, the hurricane would not have happened. this is a way to express that small changes in the initial conditions lead to drastic changes in the results.  </p>
