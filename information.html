         <p> The butterfly effect is a concept that states that "small causes can have larger effects".

This concept was initially used in theories about weather prediction but later the term became a popular metaphor in science writing. </p>

             
<p> In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. </p>

             
<p> The term itself was coined by Edward Lorenz, and is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (exact time of formation, exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant butterfly several weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed that runs of his weather model with initial condition data that was rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome.</p>

             
<p> The idea that small causes may have large effects in general and in weather specifically was used from Henri Poincaré to Norbert Wiener. Edward Lorenz's work placed the concept of instability of the earth's atmosphere onto a quantitative base and linked the concept of instability to the properties of large classes of dynamic systems which are undergoing nonlinear dynamics and deterministic chaos. </p>

             
<p> The butterfly effect can also be demonstrated by very simple systems. For example, the randomness of the outcomes of throwing dice depends on this characteristic to amplify small differences in initial conditions—the precise direction, thrust, and orientation of the throw—into significantly different dice paths and outcomes, which makes it virtually impossible to throw a dice exactly the same way twice. </p>
        
<p> Recurrence, the approximate return of a system towards its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making complex systems, such as the weather, difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather) since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.

A dynamical system displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate.[2] The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical.

If M is the state space for the map {\displaystyle f^{t}} f^{t}, then {\displaystyle f^{t}} f^{t} displays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in M and any δ > 0, there are y in M, with distance d(. , .) such that {\displaystyle 0<d(x,y)<\delta } 0<d(x,y)<\delta  and such that

{\displaystyle d(f^{\tau }(x),f^{\tau }(y))>\mathrm {e} ^{a\tau }\,d(x,y)} d(f^{\tau }(x),f^{\tau }(y))>\mathrm {e} ^{a\tau }\,d(x,y)
for some positive parameter a. The definition does not require that all points from a neighborhood separate from the base point x, but it requires one positive Lyapunov exponent.

The simplest mathematical framework exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions is provided by a particular parametrization of the logistic map:

{\displaystyle x_{n+1}=4x_{n}(1-x_{n}),\quad 0\leq x_{0}\leq 1,} x_{n+1}=4x_{n}(1-x_{n}),\quad 0\leq x_{0}\leq 1,
which, unlike most chaotic maps, has a closed-form solution:

{\displaystyle x_{n}=\sin ^{2}(2^{n}\theta \pi )} x_{n}=\sin ^{2}(2^{n}\theta \pi )
where the initial condition parameter {\displaystyle \theta } \theta  is given by {\displaystyle \theta ={\tfrac {1}{\pi }}\sin ^{-1}(x_{0}^{1/2})} \theta ={\tfrac {1}{\pi }}\sin ^{-1}(x_{0}^{1/2}). For rational {\displaystyle \theta } \theta , after a finite number of iterations {\displaystyle x_{n}} x_{n} maps into a periodic sequence. But almost all {\displaystyle \theta } \theta  are irrational, and, for irrational {\displaystyle \theta } \theta , {\displaystyle x_{n}} x_{n} never repeats itself – it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos – stretching and folding: the factor 2n shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect), while the squared sine function keeps {\displaystyle x_{n}} x_{n} folded within the range.</p>
